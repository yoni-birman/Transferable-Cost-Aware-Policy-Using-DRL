# Appendix A - Detector Analysis: Additional Thresholds
To further demonstrate that no detector is dominated by another, we repeated the experiments presented in Table II, but with a fixed false positives rate 5\%. 
We argue that this scenario is typical of actual use cases where organizations determine a fixed false positives rate, setting its value at a level that would enable human experts to analyze all alerts.
The results of our additional experiments are presented in the below table. 
The results show that for both datasets -- PE and APK -- no detector is dominated by another. 
Moreover, the large variance in the detection rates for the originally misclassified files -- larger than those presented in Table II in some cases -- further supports our claim that an intelligent selection of detector subsets can maintain high performance at a fraction of the resources-use.
